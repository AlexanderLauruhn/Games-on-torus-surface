# Minesweeper on Torus Surface
This is a unique take on the classic Minesweeper game, where the playing field wraps around a torus surface. 
Navigate through the toroidal grid, avoid mines, and uncover safe areas to win the game. So there are no borders.
The rules are the same as
the normal minesweeper with a flat surface. There are three levels of difficulty.

Welcome to Toroidal Maze Game! This is not your ordinary maze â€“ immerse yourself in a unique challenge as you navigate a maze set on a torus surface.

# Blokus on Torus Surface
Blokus might be an more or less unknown game: However, it is easy to explain but challenging to play. Try to set as much figures as possible into the surface. Each figure must touch another figure of the same color on a corner, not at an edge. A position can only get filled by one color. If you have troubles to find where you can add a figure, just press the button 'h' for helf. It will show you, where you can add the next figure. 
Your opponent is a bot finding every available position for itself. So do not underestimate the challenge to win against your opponent.
